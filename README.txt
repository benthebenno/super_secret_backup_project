How to Play:

    The goal of this game is to make sure the increasing number Squirrels are safe and do not stumble into any bombs that were carelessly left around. 
    Every turn you have the choice to select a squirrel to move while the rest will move any way that pleases them. Enter p to safely exit.
    Good luck

    P.S Squirrels are friendly and will share the same square.

    P.P.S Obie is Squirrel number one, because of course he is.

Current High Score: 15
